## Using bsp

bsp is a set of tools provided by Radxa to quickly build U-Boot Kernel, using bsp it is very easy to build your own U-Boot and Kernel.

Below you will find an example of how to build a kernel with bsp using the Radxa ZERO 3.

### bsp environment configuration

The following is the `bsp` recommended environment.  
Hardware: x86_64 PC recommended  
System: Ubuntu or Debian

#### Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git qemu-user-static binfmt-support

# Podman (recommend)
sudo apt install -y podman podman-docker
sudo touch /etc/containers/nodocker
# Docker
#sudo apt install docker.io

# Optional dependencies for minor functions
sudo apt install -y systemd-container
```

#### Get Code

`bsp` uses the git submodule. Therefore, use the following command to get the code:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/radxa-repo/bsp.git
```

#### Understanding `bsp` Usage

After getting the `bsp` code on your machine, you can run `bsp` to see the built-in help:

```bash
cd bsp
./bsp
```

### Build Kernel

After completing the bsp environment configuration, you need to compile the kernel once before pulling the kernel code from the repository.  
Running `. /bsp` will show all the parameters and their explanations, and the command `bsp [options] <linux|u-boot> <profile> [product]` can be found from the prompt.  
Using Radxa ZERO 3 as an example, flash the official image, wait for the system to run normally, and then execute `uname -r` on the development board to get the kernel name as `5.10.160-28-rk356x`.  
Then put the kernel name suffix `rk356x` into the `profile` parameter of the bsp command, e.g. `. /bsp linux rk356x` to build the kernel.  
The path to the kernel source code is located in the bsp directory at `.src/linux`, and the kernel can be built again after modifying the kernel source code:

```
./bsp --no-prepare-source linux rk356x -r 20

Parameter Description:
--no-prepare-source

# Compile using local modifications. If this parameter is not added, the latest code will be synchronized from the Radxa kernel warehouse and the local modifications will be overwritten.

-r 20

# Specify the kernel version number as 20
```

For more bsp parameter usage instructions, you can execute `./bsp` to view.

After compilation is completed, many `deb` packages will be generated in the current directory. You only need to install the following two `deb` packages.

```
linux-headers-5.10.160-20-rk356x_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
linux-image-5.10.160-20-rk356x_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
```

Copy the above two `deb` packages to the board and use the `dpkg` command to install them to complete the kernel installation.

```
sudo dpkg -i linux-image-5.10.160-20-rk356x_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-5.10.160-20-rk356x_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
sudo reboot
```

After the restart is complete, you can use `uname -a` to check the currently started kernel version number to see whether the installation was successful.

## Manual compilation

:::tip
`bsp` is the only compilation method that is currently supported, and it makes additional changes to the source code during the build.
If you want to develop based on our official releases, you should at least use `bsp` to download and configure the source code.

If you want to use a custom `make` command to compile, please refer to the [Prepare working tree](https://radxa-repo.github.io/bsp/dev_flow.html#prepare-working-tree) section to prepare the code.
