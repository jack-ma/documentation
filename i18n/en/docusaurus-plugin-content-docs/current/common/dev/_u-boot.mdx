## Using bsp

bsp is a set of tools provided by Radxa to quickly build a U-Boot Kernel. It is very easy to build your own U-Boot and Kernel using bsp.

Below you will find an example of how to build a U-Boot with bsp using the Radxa ZERO 3.

### bsp environment configuration

The following is the `bsp` recommended environment.  
Hardware: x86_64 PC recommended  
System: Ubuntu or Debian

#### Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git qemu-user-static binfmt-support

# Podman (recommend)
sudo apt install -y podman podman-docker
sudo touch /etc/containers/nodocker
# Docker
#sudo apt install docker.io

# Optional dependencies for minor functions
sudo apt install -y systemd-container
```

#### Get Code

`bsp` uses the git submodule. Therefore, use the following command to get the code:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/radxa-repo/bsp.git
```

#### Understanding `bsp` Usage

After getting the `bsp` code on your machine, you can run `bsp` to see the built-in help:

```bash
cd bsp
./bsp
```

### Build U-Boot

After finishing the bsp environment configuration, you need to compile U-Boot once before pulling U-Boot code from the repository.  
Running `. /bsp` will show all the parameters and their explanations, and the command `bsp [options] <linux|u-boot> <profile> [product]` can be found from the prompt.  
Take Radxa ZERO 3 as an example, flash the official image, wait for the system to run normally, and then execute `sudo apt list --installed | grep u-boot` on the development board to get the U-Boot package name `u-boot-latest`.  
Then fill in the `profile` parameter of the bsp command with the U-Boot package name suffix `latest` e.g. `. /bsp u-boot latest radxa-zero3` to build U-Boot.  
The path to the U-Boot source code is located at `.src/u-boot` in the bsp directory. You can build U-Boot again after modifying the U-Boot source code:

```
./bsp --no-prepare-source u-boot latest radxa-zero3

Parameter Description:
--no-prepare-source

#Compile with local changes, if you don't add this parameter it will sync the latest code from the Radxa U-Boot repository and overwrite the local changes.
```

For more bsp parameter usage instructions, you can execute `./bsp` to view.

After compilation, many `deb` packages will be generated in the current directory, you just need to install the following `deb` packages.

```
u-boot-latest_2023.10-1_arm64.deb
```

Copy the above two `deb` packages to the board and install them with the `dpkg` command to complete the U-Boot installation.

```
sudo dpkg -i u-boot-latest_2023.10-1_arm64.deb
```

U-Boot needs to be flashed onto the boot media after the installation is complete.

```
cd /usr/lib/u-boot/radxa-zero3/
sudo ./setup.sh update_bootloader /dev/mmcblk1   #/dev/mmcblk1 is the boot media you are currently using, you need to select it according to the actual device you are using
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, you can observe the U-Boot boot log to see if U-Boot has been successfully updated.

## Manual compilation

:::tip
`bsp` is the only compilation method that is currently supported, and it makes additional changes to the source code during the build.
If you want to develop based on our official releases, you should at least use `bsp` to download and configure the source code.

If you want to use a custom `make` command to compile, please refer to the [Prepare working tree](https://radxa-repo.github.io/bsp/dev_flow.html#prepare-working-tree) section to prepare the code.
