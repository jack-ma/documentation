Corrected footprint for TYPE-C connectors
Reduced footprint of ESD0402
Separated 1L2 and 1L4 to reduce the possibility of circuit shorting
Replaced FUSB340 with CH482
Power LED can now be controlled by GPIOAO_8
Therefore, pin 35 (GPIOAO_8) is not connected to the 40-pin header

### 1.5 (Fine tune)

Switch to other USB configuration channel controllers due to chip shortage

### 1.51 (Fine tune)

Power LED can now be controlled by GPIOAO_10
Therefore, pin 35 (GPIOAO_8) is now connected to the 40-pin header
Pin 38 (GPIOAO_10) is now not connected to the 40-pin header

## Flash Tools

- [Zagdig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/): Windows Maskrom Driver.
- [RZ USB Boot Helper](https://dl.radxa.com/zero/tools/windows/RZ_USB_Boot_Helper_V1.0.0.zip): Windows bootloader Load Tool.
- [factory-loader.img](https://dl.radxa.com/zero/images/loader/factory-loader.img): Used to erase eMMC on Windows. not recommended.
- [radxa-zero-erase-emmc.bin](https://dl.radxa.com/zero/images/loader/radxa-zero-erase-emmc.bin): Automatically erases the eMMC and then displays the eMMC as a USB storage device. This is the recommended method for burning Linux images.
- [rz-fastboot-loader.bin](https://dl.radxa.com/zero/images/loader/rz-fastboot-loader.bin): Enables fastboot mode, but cannot be used to install our official Android system.
- [android-bootloader.img](https://dl.radxa.com/zero/images/loader/android-bootloader.img): Same as bootloader.img in our official Android image. Some distributions use this bootloader.
- [rz-udisk-loader.bin](https://dl.radxa.com/zero/images/loader/rz-udisk-loader.bin): Embedded eMMC as a USB mass storage device.
