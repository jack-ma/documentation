## Preparation

## Development preparation

### Power Supply

ZERO is powered by Type-C connector with 5V input voltage, recommended to use a power adapter with a rated maximum current greater than 2A.  
We recommend using the official [Radxa Power PD 30W](../accessories/pd-30w). <img src="/img/accessories/pd-30w.webp" alt="Radxa Power PD 30W" width="300" />

### Boot Media

Onboard eMMC or sd-card  
If the board doesn't have an onboard eMMC([The eMMC is located on the back of the board](../hardware-design/hardware-interface#interface-overview)) you need to prepare a sd card with at least 8GB.  
If you need to install an image with desktop environment, please use a sd card with at least 16GB, 32GB is recommended.

### microSD card reader

For flashing the system image.

### Monitor

The Radxa ZERO has a micro HDMI video output port on board, which requires a micro HDMI to standard HDMI cable to connect to the monitor.  
The resolution of the HDMI output depends on the monitor, and the Radxa ZERO will adjust to the optimal display resolution according to the monitor.

### Networking

ZERO has an ap6212/ap6256/aw-cm256sm WiFi/BT module on board.

### Type-C Hub

The Radxa ZERO has an onboard [Type-C USB3.0](../hardware-design/hardware-interface#interface-overview). This interface supports Type-A ports and wired networks via the USB Type-C hub (if the hub supports it), but does not have video out.

### USB Mouse and Keyboard

The Radxa ZERO can be controlled by a keyboard and mouse connected to the USB Hub.
